       Hi there, I'm <strong class="highlight">Th√©o Savourat</strong>, 25 years old, and I'm a <strong class="highlight">web developer</strong> and I am a recent graduate in web development, driven by the passion to create innovative digital experiences. </p> `,

       <p class="description-paragraph">
        After five years of studies in the fields of management and finance, culminating in a <strong class="highlight">master's degree in finance</strong>, I made the decision in 2023 to reorient myself towards web development. Although my previous studies didn't inspire me, I persevered to obtain my master's degree. However, I quickly felt the need to turn to a field that truly excites me.</p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">
        My interest in digital technology, the web, and logic naturally led me to web development. This choice was driven by my belief that development is a constantly evolving field, offering perpetual learning and continuous intellectual stimulation. The logical aspect and the opportunity to constantly learn intrigued and motivated me to undertake this career change.</p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">
        My <strong class="highlight"> transition </strong> into the field of web development took shape through an intensive six-month training program aimed at obtaining the <strong class="highlight"> professional certificate in web and mobile development </strong>, which I successfully completed in January 2024. Equipped with the skills acquired during this training, I am determined to further my professional development in the field of web development. </p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">
        Currently, I am particularly interested in <strong class="highlight">opportunities</strong> in the fields of <strong class="highlight">front-end, back-end, or full-stack development</strong> within innovative and dynamic companies where I can contribute to innovative projects while continuing to learn and grow.</p>

        <p class="description-paragraph">
        My previous experience has equipped me with analytical skills and strategic thinking that complement the technical skills acquired during my web development training. I am confident that my successful transition to web development, combined with these skills, will enable me to bring a unique perspective and added value to any project I contribute to.</p>
